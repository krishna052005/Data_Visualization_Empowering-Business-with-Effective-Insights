# 📊 Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights
# 📝 Project Overview

This project is part of a Forage job simulation where I worked as a data consultant for an online retail store. The objective was to analyze transactional data and create executive-level dashboards to support strategic decision-making for the CEO and CMO, focusing on revenue growth and expansion opportunities.

# Business Objectives

Understand revenue trends and seasonality
Identify top-performing countries and customers
Analyze product demand across regions
Provide actionable insights to support business expansion strategy

# 🧹Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy:
Removed transactions with negative quantities (returns)
Excluded records with invalid unit prices (≤ 0)
Created a Revenue metric (Quantity × Unit Price)
Filtered data based on business requirements (e.g., excluding the UK where needed)

# 📈 Visualizations Created (Power BI)

Each visual was created on a separate report page as per executive requirements:
Monthly Revenue Trend (2011)
Line chart showing seasonality and revenue patterns to support forecasting.

Top 10 Countries by Revenue (Excluding UK)
Column chart highlighting key markets along with quantity sold.

Top 10 Customers by Revenue

# 📌 Key Insights

A small number of countries and customers contribute significantly to total revenue.
